# Shape's Hard Skill Test - Machine Learning Engineer

The challenge consists of refactoring the `job_test_challenge.py` script into a
modularized code (preferably object-oriented), implementing best practices,
proper documentation, and making it more suitable for a product release. A few
`TODOs` are included in the code and must be implemented.

The code can be freely and fully changed, only ensuring its main purpose does
not change. The `artifacts/pipeline.jsonc` file structure can also be changed
to better integrate with the new code.

If there are mapped changes that would be more complex to implement or there
was not enough time, leave an indication of the planned changes as `TODO` and
the approach strategies. It is important that the generated code can be safely
executed in another python environment.

Consider that this code would be delivered to a production environment on a big
data scenario, where the sample data file represents a gigabytes size table on
a data lake.

> P.S.: The pickle files were generated using `python=3.8.13` and
> `scikit-learn==1.0.2`. Other libraries will be necessary but were not used in
> the generation of the pickle files.

**After finishing, please attach, together with all the files generated on the
refactor process, a README.md file that explains the chosen strategy and the
reason behind the implemented changes. Extra features are encouraged and will
be taken into consideration.**

## Suggestions

- As the test is focused on the code, it is best to avoid writing your solution
  on top of full-featured frameworks that abstract the code and make harder to
  track the reason behind the changes.
- This challenge is not intended to be time consuming. If you are having
  trouble, try to simplify the code and focus on the main points.
- Explaining your decisions and the reasons behind them is as important as the
  code itself.
- If you use git, do not forget to include the `.git` folder in the zip file.
- As this challenge is individual, we appreciate if you do not share your
  solution on any public platform.
